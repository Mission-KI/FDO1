# Contributing to FDO1

Thank you for your interest in contributing to FDO1! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- Feature branches: `feature/your-feature-name`
- Bug fix branches: `bugfix/bug-name`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/issue-name`
- Release branches: `release/version`

## Development Workflow

1. Create an issue for the task or feature
2. Create a branch from `develop` with the appropriate prefix
3. Make your changes with clear, descriptive commits
4. Push your branch and create a pull request to `develop`
5. Address any feedback from code reviews
6. Your changes will be merged once approved

## Commit Message Guidelines

Format: `[TYPE]: Brief description`

Types:
- FEAT: A new feature
- FIX: A bug fix
- DOCS: Documentation changes
- STYLE: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- REFACTOR: Code refactoring
- TEST: Adding or updating tests
- CHORE: Maintenance tasks

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code follows the project's style guide
2. Update documentation as needed
3. Add tests for new features
4. Make sure all tests pass
5. Get at least one approval from a reviewer

## Code Review Guidelines

- Be respectful and constructive
